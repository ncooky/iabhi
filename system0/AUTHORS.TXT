Currently I'm the only developer (ovidio AT users.sourceforge.net). I used code from some other projects that are
listed in the website (http://bfexplorer.sourceforge.net). If you are interested in developing, helping with the
documentation, making translations or offering new ideas please contact me (ovidio AT users.sourceforge.net).
For version 0.0.7 Hannes Vaher (hannes AT linksys DOT ee) contributed an estonian translation.
For version 0.0.9 Dan Fuglø (dan AT fuglo DOT com) contributed a daninsh translation.
